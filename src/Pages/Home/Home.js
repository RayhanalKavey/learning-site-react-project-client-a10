                  React is a JavaScript library for building the user interface
                  for web and mobile, developed by Facebook in 2011. It is
                  open-sourced recently in 2015, but it has one of the largest
                  communities supporting it.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    JSX: It is a JavaScript syntax extension that describes the
                    visual appearance of the user interface. With the help of
                    JSX, we can write HTML-like structures in JavaScript files.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Virtual dom(VDOM): Reactâ€™s virtual DOM is a JavaScript
                    representation of the actual DOM. When updates are made
                    React compares the current DOM to the virtual DOM and only
                    updates the differences between the two. Virtual DOM synced
                    with the real DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This
                    process is called reconciliation. When the state of an
                    object changes virtual DOM only changes that object in the
                    real DOM, rather than updating the whole DOM. This results
                    in a much faster web application.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Divide into components: Splits the user interface into
                    independent components, so that independent components can
                    be processed separately. React breaks web elements down into
                    reusable components making it easy to manage complex web
                    interfaces.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Unidirectional data binding: React support unidirectional in
                    other words one-way data binding, which means nesting child
                    components within parent components.

                hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
                appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
                classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing
                and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with
                custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth
                noting that just about any HTML can go within the{" "}
                <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit
                overflow.
